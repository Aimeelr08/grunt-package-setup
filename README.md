Bower with Grunt.js
Bower is a package manager for front-end components like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, fonts and image files.

In this example we use Grunt and the Wiredep Grunt plugin to find the installed Bower components, in this case jQuery (specified in bower.json), and inject them directly into the index.html file.
